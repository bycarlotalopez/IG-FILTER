# IG-FILTER


DONE: OPTION PICKER WITH 3 DIFFERENT TEXTURES TAKEN FROM GENERATIVE SCARFS
-LAST WEEK I COULDNT SEEM TO MAKE THE PICKER GO BACK TO FIRST OPTION BUT THIS IS FIXED NOW

ERROR: CAN'T SEEM TO CONNECT GRADIENT COLOURS TO PICKER- ONLY SEEMS TO CONNECT BETWEEN TEXTURE DISTORTION SHADER AND MATERIAL0 AND THE RESULT IS TOO STRONG- I HAVE TRIED TO USE BRIGHTNESS/ EXPOSURE/ HUE AND SAT AND NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK
-IF YOU THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE OR IF YOU CAN FIND WHAT I AM DOING WRONG LET ME KNOW

ERROR2: THE QUALITY OF THE WHOLE FILTER SEEMS TO BE A BIT PIXELATED? NOT SURE IF THERE IS A WAY OF FIXING THIS- I WILL KEEP LOOKING

OPINION NEEDED ON SCARF FILTER AND WHAT TO IMPROVE
